To store negative number in memory follow the following steps
For eg., store '-5' value

1. Ignore the '-' sign
2. Convert the value to binary
3. Take 2's compliment and store in memory

For value '-5'
convert to binary   -> 0...0000 101
1's compliment      -> 1...1111 010
2's compliment      ->           +1
                    -> 1...1111 011
Print will look for first bit which 1 so the computer will understand this is a negative number
then it will apply 1's compliment & 2's compliment for value
