Pseudocode is generic way of representing your solution. It can be written in whichever way you prefer. Basically its like providing a rough solution.

For eg. Find the prime number between 1 to n

Pseudocode will be as given below.

For this solution prime number is a number where n%1=0 and n%n=0 but if the prime number is in modulus with any number between 2 to (n-1) it will never be 0


1. Read n
2. Loop items from 1 to n
3. Take num = 2 
4. if num < n  and n != 1   
5. then
6. if n%num != 0
7.       print n
8.      Take next number and assign num=2 again
9. else num = num + 1
10. Go to step 2
